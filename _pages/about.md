I am an Assistant Professor in the Institute for Software Research at Carnegie Mellon University. I have broad research interests at the intersection of programming languages and human-computer interaction. I am particularly interested in better understanding of the factors that influence the usability of reusable software components.

I am fortunate to work with amazing PhD students. I advise [Jenna Wise](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jlwise/) (co-advised by [Jonathan Aldrich](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aldrich/)), [Wode "Nimo" Ni](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~woden/) (co-advised by [Ken Koedinger](http://pact.cs.cmu.edu/koedinger.html)), [Matthew Davis](http://cmumatt.github.io) (co-advised by [Brad Myers](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bam/)), [Sam Estep](https://samestep.com/) (co-advised by [Keenan Crane](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/)), and [Ian McCormack](https://icmccorm.me/) (co-advised by [Jonathan Aldrich](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aldrich/)) .

I direct the [Research Experience for Undergraduates in interdisciplinary Software Engineering (REUSE)](https://reuse.cs.cmu.edu/) program with [Charlie Garrod](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~charlie/) and [Claire Le Goues](https://clairelegoues.com/). The program provides an opportunity for a diverse cohort of undergraduates from school across the country to spend the summer working with the world's leading computer scientists. Students conduct research in a broad range of areas, including: collaboration and teams, computational statistics, computer architecture, diagrams and visualization, data mining and analysis, embedded systems, human-computer interaction, networking, privacy, program synthesis, program repair, programming languages, security, software architecture, societal computing, software requirements, and testing.

I completed my PhD in Software Engineering from Carnegie Mellon in December 2013. My dissertation focused on the usability of software libraries with ordering constraints (API protocols). I graduated from Brandeis University in 2004 and worked for almost four years as a software engineer before starting graduate school. I'm married to Kira Sunshine, and we have three children: Akiva, Elisheva, and Tamir.
