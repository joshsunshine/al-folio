I am an Assistant Professor of [Computer Science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). My home department is the [Software and Societal Systems Department (S3D)](https://s3d.cmu.edu/) and I have a courtesy appointment in the [Human-Computer Interacation Institute](https://hcii.cmu.edu/). 

I have broad research interests at the intersection of programming languages and human-computer interaction. I am particularly interested in better understanding of the factors that influence the usability of reusable software components.

I am fortunate to work with amazing students. See my [advising page](./advising/) for details.

I direct the [Research Experience for Undergraduates in interdisciplinary Software Engineering (REUSE)](https://reuse.cs.cmu.edu/) program with [Charlie Garrod](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~charlie/) and [Claire Le Goues](https://clairelegoues.com/). The program provides an opportunity for a diverse cohort of undergraduates from school across the country to spend the summer working with the world's leading computer scientists. Students conduct research in a broad range of areas, including: collaboration and teams, computational statistics, computer architecture, diagrams and visualization, data mining and analysis, embedded systems, human-computer interaction, networking, privacy, program synthesis, program repair, programming languages, security, software architecture, societal computing, software requirements, and testing.

I completed my PhD in Software Engineering from Carnegie Mellon in December 2013. My dissertation focused on the usability of software libraries with ordering constraints (API protocols). I graduated from Brandeis University in 2004 and worked for almost four years as a software engineer before starting graduate school. I'm married to Kira Sunshine, and we have three children: Akiva, Elisheva, and Tamir.
