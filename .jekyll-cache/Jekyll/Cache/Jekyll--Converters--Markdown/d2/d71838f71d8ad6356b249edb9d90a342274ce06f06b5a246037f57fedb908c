I"u<p>I am a Senior Research Fellow in the Institute for Software Research at Carnegie Mellon University. I have broad research interests at the intersection of programming languages and human-computer interaction. I am particularly interested in better understanding of the factors that influence the usability of reusable software components.</p>

<p>I am fortunate to work with amazing PhD students. I advise <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jlwise/">Jenna Wise</a> (co-advised by <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aldrich/">Jonathan Aldrich</a>) and <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~woden/">Wode “Nimo” Ni</a> (co-advised by <a href="http://pact.cs.cmu.edu/koedinger.html">Ken Koedinger</a>). I also collaborate with <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kqy/">Katherine Ye</a>.</p>

<p>I  direct the  <a href="https://reuse.cs.cmu.edu/">Research Experience for Undergraduates in interdisciplinary Software Engineering (REUSE)</a> program with <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~charlie/">Charlie Garrod</a> and <a href="https://clairelegoues.com/">Claire Le Goues</a>. The program provides an opportunity for a diverse cohort of undergraduates from school accross the country to spend the summer working with the world’s leading computer scientists. Students conduct research in a broad range of areas, including: collaboration and teams, computational statistics, computer architecture, diagrams and visualization, data mining and analysis, embedded systems, human-computer interaction, networking, privacy, program synthesis, program repair, programming languages, security, software architecture, societal computing, software requirements, and testing.</p>

<p>I completed my PhD in Software Engineering from Carnegie Mellon in December 2013. My dissertation focused on the usability of software libraries with ordering constraints (API protocols). I was advised by <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aldrich/">Jonathan Aldrich</a>.</p>

<p>I graduated from Brandeis University in 2004 and worked for almost four years as a software engineer before starting graduate school. I’m married to Kira Sunshine, and we have three children, Akiva, Elisheva, and Tamir.</p>
